**1.** I decided to install Ubuntu, a Linux-based operating system, based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software. After some obstacles, I finally installed this operating system.

**2.** Then I installed the “starting pack” of a software engineer on my machine. Beggining with, I installed `zsh` by updating the repository with the command

```sudo apt-get update```

and then install by running the following command:

```sudo apt-get install zsh```


And to check the existence of zsh, we can use this command:

Afterwards I installed `oh-my-zsh`.This installation can be carried out using `Curl` or `Wget` commands in the terminal, by using the command:

``` sudo apt install curl wget git```

Next, install `oh-my-zsh` via the command-line with wget:

```sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"```

Then I installed `git`, `gcc` and `Visual Studio Code`

**3.**
Finishing with that, I created a Git repository with the command `mkdir`. Then I wrote a small hello-world program in C and compiled it using GCC and Makefile.

Lastly, I pushed them to my git repository.
